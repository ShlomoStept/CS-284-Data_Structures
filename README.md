# CS-284-Data_Structures
Stevens Institute of Technology Discrete Structures class

## Description 
* This course is an introduction to fundamental data structures in Computer Science. These data structures, and the algorithms that go with them, make up the standard tool kit for programmers regardless of language and application.
* We will use the Java programming language for representing both the data structures and also for developing  simple  programming  projects that put them to use. Expect to do a significant amount of programming, as well as paper and pencil exercises.

## Learning Objectives 
* (Abstract Data Types) Understand the importance of Abstract Data Types and Data Structures. Use UML to represent ADTs.
* (Complexity) Calculate the Big O of diverse non-recursive algorithms and use it to compare efficiency.
* (Collections) Use and understand Collection class in Java, with major emphasis on Lists, Stacks and Queues. Implement double linked lists in Java.
* (Trees) Implement Binary Search Trees, Max/Min-Heaps, Priority Queues in Java, and understand the basic concepts of self-balancing Binary Search Trees such as Red-Black and AVL trees.
* (Sets-Maps) Understand what are Sets and Maps, and more specifically implement hash tables in Java.
* (Sorting) Program basic sorting algorithms (such as Insertion, Selection, Merge and Quick) in Java using the Comparable interface.
* (Programming) Combine different classes together to implement big programming assignments in Java, including a final project that combines some of the data structures studied in class.
* (Testing) Use JUnit to create unit tests for each project.
